# React Fiber Architecture

A description of React's new core algorithm, React Fiber.

## Overview

React Fiber is the reimplementation of React’s core algorithm to improve its capability in scheduling and prioritizing updates. This enables better rendering performance, responsiveness, and concurrency. It is designed to enhance the reconciliation process and support features such as Suspense, concurrent rendering, and better UI responsiveness.

## Key Features

- **Incremental Rendering**: Breaks rendering work into units that can be spread over multiple frames.
- **Concurrency**: Allows React to prioritize updates, improving performance.
- **Better Handling of Animations**: React Fiber improves animation and layout transitions.
- **New Reconciliation Algorithm**: More efficient tree reconciliation process.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Error boundaries provide better error recovery.

## Architecture Overview

React Fiber introduces several changes in how React processes updates:

1. **Work Units**: Updates are broken into small chunks of work that can be paused and resumed.
2. **Priority-Based Scheduling**: Critical updates are prioritized over non-essential ones.
3. **New Data Structures**: Fiber nodes replace React elements for better efficiency.

## Benefits of React Fiber

- Improved rendering performance for complex UIs.
- Enhanced user experience through better responsiveness.
- Efficient background processing of non-urgent updates.
- Better support for asynchronous rendering.

## Conclusion

React Fiber revolutionizes React’s rendering process, making it more powerful and flexible. This redesign enables features that improve UI performance, animations, and user interactions while ensuring a smooth development experience.
